# useful_sample_codes
Here, I will add some sample codes which I have found useful in doing different projects, they will be very short, 
not more than 10 -15 lines to do a useful job for you.
I did not decide yet, but I may create other repositories like this for different languages, in this case, this would 
be pure bash scripting.
